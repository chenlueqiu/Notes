hold your fucking tongues
align yourselves with Rome
to what end?
how it is to be measured?
he speaks out of turn, yet the truth falls from his mouth
I've asked the gods to bless your sword
nothing will keep me from returning to your arms
hold the line!
my own shit would taste better
we will finish this discussion later
too brief to tell
Greeks are of pressing concern
the Senate chamber is full of whispers of your early return
get out of my sight
ingrate shitholes
he is in a fine state
he refuses his daughter nothing when pleaded with a teary eye
Barca, the Beast of Carthage
the god of blood and sand, Crixus
gratitude to Batiatus
that man has fingers in all the proper assholes
good to lay the eyes, old friend
I should witness his heart on a day apart from his chest
I would hold something of note for the last
by this condition, I doubt he could survive to the quarter moon
I never cared to ask
there is no life without you
the gods themselves could not keep me from your side
the pig-fucker's still alive
I give no shit to who he is
smells like fresh shit
the Undefeated
that explains why you smell like a woman
we will revisit that remark after you gain your strength
pile of shit, not a cock among them
prove yourselves in the hard days to follow
prove yourselves more than a common slave
fail and die
he embraces it, caresses it.
none of you stray dogs would last a fleeting moment
gaze at this man, study him, and realize, he is nothing
your name, your life is what we decide
become entangled with a more powerful opponent and you are dead
introduce your brains to the sand
above this unfortunate collection
better, yes, within the reach of my purse, no
bake them into brick or crumble them to the mines
your will, my hands
the shit would be running down your leg
speaking otherwise is bloated air
win the hearts of the crowd
keep pace!
return to your dreams
it's in the hands of the gods now
Jupiter's cock!
I ask nothing in return
your life is no longer yours to bargain
these common dishes leave my stomach unsettled
Jupiter could hurl a bolt at any moment
oh, apologies
the choice is yours
positions!
one final lesson before I send you to the afterlife
yet his tongue still manages to find his way to the magistrate's asshole
odds the meal would be your last
a man's fame and glory constructs its own truth
I seek neither
she has very refined tastes
the lands from which you hail matters no longer
the only thing that does is the sound of my voice
one not to be straightened
my blood rises
a gladiator's first distraction is his last
the oath I swore to this place did not include begging
Pluto's asshole
the answer has no balance with your actions
may the gods be with you
we should prove otherwise
to what aim
away from prying ears
